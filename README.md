                                               #Overview of Project

Maria, the chief data scientist for the city school district, is responsible for all standardized test data for analysis to provide inside trends for the student's performance. Our objective is to aggregate and analyze student funding and test scores data; to showcase school performance trends.

                                                   #Analysis
						   
The school board has concluded that there might be academic dishonesty in 9th-grade math and reading at Thomas High School. We replaced math and reading values in 9th grade with NaN values and kept the rest of the data intact.

                                                     #Results
						     
School District Summary: As we can see, we have 15 schools with 39170 students in both cases.  Partial removal of the student math and reading data had no effect on did not affect the school district summary.

Changing 9th-grade math values to NaN for Thomas high school did not affect 10th, 11th or 12th grade or other schools.

Changing 9th-grade reading values to NaN for Thomas high school did not affect 10th, 11th or 12th grade or other schools.

We do see a slight variation (0.01%) in the school type scores such as math, reading, and overall passing numbers, but it is insignificant. And when we formatted the both dataframes they look identical.
